# Bioinformatics-ML-Model-for-KCNB1-Variants
Machine learning project to predict pathogenic variants in the KCNB1 gene. Uses Random Forest and cross-validation to classify variants as pathogenic or benign, comparing performance with in-silico tools like PolyPhen and SIFT. Includes data preprocessing, model evaluation, and visualization scripts for easy analysis.
